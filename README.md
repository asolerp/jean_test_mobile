# Invoicing App - React Native Project

## Introduction

This project is my submission for the React Native test, focusing on implementing an invoicing application. I've developed a solution that enables users to effortlessly manage invoices, with a strong emphasis on code quality, performance, and user experience, adhering to best development practices.

## Features

The application offers the following functionalities:

- **List existing invoices**: Users can view a list of their invoices, including relevant details for each.
- **Create new invoices**: Provides the ability to add new invoices to the system.
- **Manage existing invoices**: Users can finalize or delete invoices as needed.

### Technologies and Tools Used

- **React Native** for mobile application development.
- **NativeWind** tailwind ready for react native.
- **Context & Jotai** for state management, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Axios** along with `openapi-client-axios` for API calls, facilitating backend interaction.
- **Formik** for form management, enhancing the invoice creation and editing experience.
- **React Reanimated** for animation performances.

### Code and Project Structure

The project is structured to facilitate code readability and maintenance:

- `/api`: Configures the API client and backend interaction hooks.
- `/assets`: Stores static files like images and fonts.
- `/components`: Contains reusable UI components.
- `/navigation`: Manages app navigation configurations.
- `/screens`: Holds the app's individual screens.
- `/state`: Manages global app state contexts.
- `/utils`: Provides utility functions and helpers.

## Running the App

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
3. Start the application with `yarn start` and `yarn ios` or `yarn android`, depending on your development environment.

## Future Enhancements

I've identified several areas for future improvements and features:

- **User authentication**: Implement a login system for personalized user experiences.
- **User interface improvements**: Add animations and transitions for a smoother experience.
- **Performance optimization**: Investigate and apply React Native-specific performance optimization techniques.

## Final Thoughts

I'm open to any feedback you might offer. My goal was to create an application that is not only functional but also ready to scale and evolve. I hope you find the code organized and easy to understand, and that the application meets the proposed objectives.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this test.
